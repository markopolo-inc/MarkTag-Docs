# What is MarkTag?

In the ever-evolving realm of digital marketing, MarkTag emerges as a trailblazing first-party server solution, innovatively designed to refine and fortify the accuracy of web tracking. This powerful tool redefines the collection and transmission of user interaction data, catering to the nuanced demands of advertising platforms such as Facebook Pixel, TikTok Pixel, and Google Analytics (GA4). Amidst the digital landscape's shift towards stringent browser policies and robust data protection laws, MarkTag stands out by streamlining the tracking process while aligning with legal compliance, including GDPR. It ensures that the insights derived from user behaviors on websites are not only precise but also resilient against the phasing out of third-party cookies. MarkTag thus represents a critical advancement in digital marketing technology, promising enhanced data reliability and a seamless user experience for advertisers navigating the new age of web analytics.

## What is MarkTag and its Role?

MarkTag operates as a first-party server, meaning that it gathers data directly from the user’s interactions on the website rather than relying on third-party cookies. Its significant role is to consolidate data and ensure its accurate transmission to various platforms, thereby enhancing the efficacy of online advertising campaigns and user analytics. With third-party cookies, the identification process is vulnerable; a changed cookie results in the user being tagged as a new visitor, while a blocked cookie leads to a complete loss of interaction data. MarkTag circumvents these issues, using its own first-party data collection method that browsers are less likely to block, ensuring continuous and consistent user identification and tracking.

## Importance in Light of Changing Browser Policies

Browsers like Chrome have unveiled plans to phase out third-party cookies, with an initial 1% disablement in Q1 2024, escalating to 100% by Q3 2024, conditional on the approval by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). Safari as well as devices with iOS 14 and forward , on the other hand, already implements stringent measures against third-party cookies. These evolving browser policies underscore the vital role of MarkTag as a first-party server in maintaining the integrity and continuity of web tracking.

## First-Party vs Third-Party Cookies: A Distinction

- **First-Party Cookies**: These are set by the domain that the user is visiting directly and are generally used to improve the user experience by remembering logins, site preferences, and providing personalized content.
- **Third-Party Cookies**: In contrast, third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one the user is visiting. They are primarily used for tracking and online-advertising purposes, allowing advertisers to send targeted ads based on user behavior across different sites.

With the tightening of privacy regulations and browser restrictions on third-party cookies, MarkTag's use of first-party cookies becomes even more pivotal. By aligning with the website's domain, MarkTag ensures compliance and reduces the risk of data collection disruptions, paving the way for robust, continuous analytics and ad targeting that respect user privacy and adhere to stringent data protection standards.

## How MarkTag Works

1. **Unique ID Assignment**: MarkTag assigns a **unique ID** to each user visiting the website. **This ID acts as a first-party cookie** emanating directly from your own domain, ensuring the resilience against browser restrictions and policy changes while keeping the users anonymous and protecting the data laws and GDPR regulations.
2. **Simplified Tracking with a Single ID**: Rather than juggling multiple cookies, MarkTag utilizes a **singular unique ID for each customer**, streamlining the tracking process. This ID is dispatched to each advertising platform, ensuring consistency and accuracy across various channels.
3. **Code Integration**: Users begin by **embedding a simple code** snippet into their website. This one-time setup is all that's needed to activate MarkTag's tracking capabilities.
4. **Event Tracking Configuration**: MarkTag offers dual methodologies for event tracking – it can be set up using **code for custom implementations** or through **the user-friendly event setup tool** for a more visual and interactive experience. Once configured, MarkTag seamlessly relays event data to the respective advertising platforms.
